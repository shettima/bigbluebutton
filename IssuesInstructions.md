## I think I've found a bug ... ##

If you've found a bug (or would like to make an enhancement request), we'd like to hear about it.

To reduce the duplication of submissions, we ask you take a few moments and go through the steps below.

**1. Search the Issues database**:   [Search the complete issue database](http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list?can=1&q=&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Component+Summary&cells=tiles) to see if someone has already reported the defect or made the enhancement request.  If you find a match, add your comments to the issue (don't create a new one!) and feel fee to vote (star the issue) for its resolution.

**2.  Post to bigbluebutton-dev:** If you are not a BigBlueButton developer, we ask that you first post to [BigBlueButton-developers](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev) mailing list.

  * **For a defect post:** Please provide the host operating system, the version of the browser, the version of BigBlueButton (the build number is visible in the lower left-hand corner), the steps you have followed, the changes you have made, and the output of `sudo bbb-conf --check` if it's a server issue.

  * **For an enhancement request post:** Let us know how we can make BigBlueButton better. Give us a use case or user story.  Well thought out requests will get more attention and usually create a spirited discussion.

There are over 1000 members of bigbluebutton-dev, and all of the core developers monitor the list daily (sometimes hourly!).  When you post you'll get a quick response which will lead to either (a) resolution, (b) a request for you open a new issue, or (c) we'll go ahead and open one for you.

When creating a new issue, please add a url to the original discussion in bigbluebutton-dev.

# Note #

We have not yet released BigBlueButton 0.81-beta, so these instructions are draft until we formally release 0.81-beta.

Until then, we recommend that unless you've already been developing with BigBlueButton 0.81 to wait until 0.81-beta is out.

# Overview #
BigBlueButton 0.81-dev uses the latest version of red5.  You will not be able to develop 0.81-dev using the version of red5 that ships with 0.80.

The instructions below will update your BigBlueButton packages, including the version of red5.

# Getting Started #

To get started, first install BigBlueButton 0.81-dev using the instructions [here](081InstallationUbuntu.md).

= Introduction to Stress Testing !BigBlueButton =

This document is intended for developers who want to help stress test !BigBlueButton.

This document (currently in its early stages) gathers together the various approaches to testing !BigBlueButton.

== Quick Checks ==

!BigBlueButton has a lot of ConfigurationFiles.  A quick check to see if your !BigBlueButton server is properly configured, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --check
}}}

This script runs through numerous checks for missing process, incorrect parameter in configuration files, missing packages, Unix ports that don't have any listeners, and known error messages in log files that indicate a configuration problem.  An warnings or potential errors are printed after the message {{{* Possible Problems *}}}.  

The !BigBlueButton process generate a lot of log files.  To quickly scan all the log files for errors or exceptions, use the command

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --debug
}}}

After !BigBlueButton has been running for a while, the log files get large.  When figuring out exactly what caused the error, a common technique is to do the following:

{{{
   sudo bbb-conf --clean
   sudo bbb-conf --watch
}}}

This will clean out all the log files (so there are no errors in the loogs), and display in the terminal the network activity and output of `bbb-conf --debug` every two seconds.

Using `--watch` you can connect to the !BigBlueButton server and try a series of steps that you suspect causes an exception.  You'll see the exception appear almost immediately when it occurs.


== Stress Testing the BigBlueButton Server with Many Clients ==

A good stress test for !BigBlueButton is to generate load with many test users.  Once you have 20, 40, 80 users connected, especially for long periods of time, you can watch the memory usage on the server with a tools such as [SettingUpBigBlueButtonWithJconsole JConsole].

To generate users, use the shell script `bbb-test` located [https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/labs/stress-testing/bbb-test here].  This script will let you startup N !BigBlueButton clients on a remote !BigBlueButton server.

Run this script on a Ubuntu Desktop (either 10.04 or 10.10).  Firefox comes already installed with Flash.  

For purposes of this example, let's say we're testing the !BigBlueButton server at 192.168.0.104.  We also have a separate computer running Ubuntu Desktop that we want to open a number of test clients to the !BigBlueButton server.  

On 192.168.0.104, edit the `config.xml` and change autoJoin for the PhoneModule to true.

{{{
<module name="PhoneModule" url="PhoneModule.swf?v=VERSION" 
        uri="rtmp://192.168.0.225/sip" 
        autoJoin="false"
        dependsOn="ViewersModule"
/>
}}} 

This will automatically join new users into the voice.

Next, copy the utility bbb-test to your Ubuntu desktop.  On the Ubuntu Desktop, start !FireFox, connect to your !BigBlueButton server, and join the voice conference.  Flash will prompt you to join.  

To remove the Flash prompt, open the global Flash Privacy Settings Manager using this [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html link].  Find the IP address 192.168.0.104 and choose "always allow".

Click the mute all button.    

At this point, any subsequent !BigBlueButton clients launched from the Ubuntu desktop computer will automatically join the voice conference muted.

To launch ten more clients, enter:

{{{
   bbb-test -h 192.168.0.104 -n 10
}}}

and the utility will ten !BigBlueButton clients, each in their own tab, on the !BigBlueButton server at 192.168.0.104.

Here's a snapshot of the !FireFox client.

At this point, with a few computers running Ubuntu desktop, you can generate large numbers of !BigBlueButton clients connected to the server.  

To the !BigBlueButton server, these are all real clients (with two streams for the VoIP channels).  If you generate 50 clients, for example, then login as the 51st client and upload a presentation, it will appear on all test clients.

These scenarios are good for looking for SettingUpBigBlueButtonWithJconsole and profiling the memory usage.

#summary How to install BigBlueButton on CentOS

These instructions will walk through how to install BigBlueButton from source onto CentOS 5.3.  Installing on CentOS is NOT easy - mostly because there are so many packages for which there are no RPMs, or the only RPMs are in alternative repos.  If you have a choice of OS, use Ubuntu and save yourself a load of time.

Before starting, make sure you have a network connection (especially if you are doing this on a new VM you just set up).

{{{

# running this will tell you what version of CentOS you have:
cat /etc/issue
# this tutorial is based on
# CentOS release 5.3 (Final)

#### NOTE: If your "hostname" command does not return the proper (working)
#### IP or domain - YOU MUST REPLACE `hostname` with the proper domain or IP
#### manually - it appears several times in this documentation
#### or, you can run "hostname <your-correct-hostname> to make this script work

# we'll work mostly from the /tmp/ directory:
cd /tmp

# install JDK 6
yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk

# install MySQL server
yum install mysql-server
service mysqld start
chkconfig mysqld on

# Tomcat6 is not available in the main repos, so we will
# use the jpackage repos:
yum install jpackage-utils
wget http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage17.repo
cat jpackage17.repo | sed 's/1\.7/5.0/' > /etc/yum.repos.d/jpackage5.repo
mv jpackage17.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
yum makecache

# now you should be able to install tomcat6 easily:
yum install tomcat6

# start tomcat and configure it to automatically start on boot:
service tomcat6 start
chkconfig tomcat6 on

# for compiling your own packages, you will need the development tools
# NOTE: this installs a ton of things - and I'm not exactly sure which
#   one or more were actually needed.  and there's no way i'm uninstalling
#   them all to find out.  so, if you do find out, please comment on this article
yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"

# some more requirements for packages that we will soon install:
yum install zlib zlib-devel freetype freetype-devel libjpeg libjpeg-devel

# install swftools:
wget http://www.swftools.org/swftools-0.8.1.tar.gz
tar xzf swftools-0.8.1.tar.gz 
cd swftools-0.8.1
./configure 
make
make install
cd ..

# install ImageMagick:
yum install ImageMagick

# nginx also needs an alternative repo - using EPEL
rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
yum makecache

# now install nginx:
yum install nginx

# install activemq from source:
useradd activemq
wget http://apache.mirror.rafal.ca/activemq/apache-activemq/5.2.0/apache-activemq-5.2.0-bin.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-activemq-5.2.0-bin.tar.gz 
mv apache-activemq-5.2.0 /opt/
ln -s /opt/apache-activemq-5.2.0 /opt/activemq
chown -R activemq.activemq /opt/apache-activemq-5.2.0
chown -R activemq.activemq /opt/activemq

# Now get the init.d file that we created for you
wget http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/activemq
mv activemq /etc/init.d/

# now make that file executable, start the service and configure it to auto-start
chmod a+x /etc/init.d/activemq
service activemq start
chkconfig activemq on


# now we will install Red5 from source
useradd red5
wget http://build.xuggle.com/job/red5_jdk6_stable/131/artifact/workingcopy/red5-0.8.RC3-build-hudson-red5_jdk6_stable-131.tar.gz
tar xzf red5-0.8.RC3-build-hudson-red5_jdk6_stable-131.tar.gz 
mv red5-0.8.RC3-build-hudson-red5_jdk6_stable-131 /opt/red5-0.8
chown -R red5.red5 /opt/red5-0.8

# Now get the init.d file that we created for you
wget http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/red5
mv red5 /etc/init.d/

# now chmod the file, start and config auto-start:
chmod a+x /etc/init.d/red5
service red5 start
chkconfig red5 on

}}}


 * Now you need to install the oflaDemo that comes with Red5.  This is a manual process.

{{{

Go to:
http://<YOURIP-OR-DOMAIN>:5080/

Click on "Click here to install demos" and then choose oflaDemo java 6.

Go to:
http://<YOURIP-OR-DOMAIN>:5080/demos/

Click "View demo" under "OFLA DEMO", which should take you to:
http://<YOURIP-OR-DOMAIN>:5080/demos/ofla_demo.html

In the upper right corner, change localhost to your domain or IP, like:
rtmp://<YOURIP-OR-DOMAIN/oflaDemo 
Click connect

You would see a list of available videos. Select one to play.

 * Now prepare for Asterisk build:

{{{

 * Determine PDF2SWF, CONVERT and GS applications (manual step)
{{{
# Make a note of where pdf2swf is installed

# Note where GhostScript is installed
which gs

# You should see something like.
# /usr/bin/gs

 * Edit bbb-web properties
{{{

# Change the following:
#  - swfToolsDir to the directory where pdf2swf is located
#  - imageMagickDir to the directory where convert is located
#  - ghostScriptExec to point to the gs application
#  - change bigbluebutton.web.serverURL=http://<YOUR IP>

 * Try out BigBlueButton
  * Go to http://<YOURIP-OR-DOMAIN> which should display the bbb web page.
  * To use voice conference, using your zoiper, dial 1500 which will prompt you for the conference number.


== When things go wrong ==
 Look for logs in the following
{{{
tail -n 20 /var/log/syslog
tail -n 20 /var/log/tomcat6
tail -n 20 /opt/red5-0.8/logs
tail -n 20 /var/log/asterisk
}}}

Also ensure that port 1935 (RTMP) and port 9123 (desktop sharing) are open on your server.

== If you make it successfully through the installation ==
Good stuff!  Post a message to BigBlueButton-dev letting everyone know that you are a real developer and you have installed BigBlueButton from source ON CENTOS.  :-)

== Audio Settings Dialog ==

Clicking on the headset icon will now display an Audio Settings dialog to enable the user to

== Video Dock ==

By default a webcam will now appear within the Video Dock module, a new window that let's users easily arrange a set of remote webcams on their desk.

For example, they can arrange them vertically

== Push To Talk ==
As discussed in the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/03965da6cbbc2f14 bigbluebutton-dev mailing list], !BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-3 adds a 'push to talk' button to enable students to un-mute themselves and ask questions during the session.

For control, moderators can click the 'lock' icon next to the student's name to both lock the student's audio as muted/unmuted and remove the student's 'push to talk' button.

== Fit-to-width ==
!BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-4 can now properly display a portrait document using fit-to-width layout.

== 0.71 Features ==

While this list is not complete, here are some of the new capabilities coming in !BigBlueButton 0.71.

=== Reduced audio lag with VoIP ===

This was the bulk of our effort for 0.71.  We improved the algorithms to handle audio packets coming to and from the !BigBlueButton server.  You should experience less audio lag using VoIP when compared to 0.70.  (We'll let you judge the extent to which the lag has been reduced.)

!BigBlueButton 0.71 now supports FreeSWITCH as a voice conference server.  This enables the !BigBlueButton client to transmit either wide-band (16 kHz) Speex or the Nellymoser voice codec.   In our testing so far, we found that nellymoser scales better and will remain the default voice codec in !BigBlueButton.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Join the audio in both session, but mute one of the microphones.  Using a headset, start counting 1, 2, 3, etc.  You'll hear yourself as the VoIP packages are sent to the !BigBlueButton server from one client and are received on the other.

=== Auto display of user's video ===

When a user shares their webcam, it automatically opens on all other users connected to the virtual classroom.

*Test:* Open two !BigBlueButton sessions.  Share your webcam in one; a view webcam window should automatically appear in the other.


=== Share a region of your desktop ===

To reduce the bandwidth usage of desktop sharing, !BigBlueButton now gives the presenter the option of selecting a rectangular region of their desktop.

When you click 'Region', the desktop sharing applet will start and display dragable and resizable selection area appears on your screen.

*Test:* Try sharing a region of your desktop with other participants.  You can also open two !BigBlueButton sessions and share your desktop from one; a view desktop window should automatically open in the others.


=== Change your locale from within the client ===

The !BigBlueButton client will detect your locale and choose the associated localization strings (if available).  There is now a drop-down menu to manually choose a locale (which helps test support for other languages).  When chosen, the interface will automatically switch to that language.

*Test:* Try changing the localization setting.  If you understand the language in a different localization setting, see if the user interface strings make sense.


=== Automatic translation of chat messages using Google Translate ===

When someone types you a message from a different locale, the Chat window will automatically use Google Translate to translate messages to your language.

*Test:* Try opening two !BigBlueButton sessions and change the locale  session in one.  Try typing test -- the text will be translated by Google Translate.

The chat window now shows local times for messages. 

=== Branding of your !BigBlueButton instance ===
You can now change the look and feel of bbb using css. Check the [Branding Branding] page for more info.

=== Configuration of !BigBlueButton client ===
You now have more control over certain functionality of !BigBlueButton. You can change the video quality, define who can share video, allow moderators to kick users, etc... Check the [ClientConfiguration Client Configuration] page for more info.


=== Breakout Meetings (experimental) ===
Sometimes you want to split up your conference into several smaller meetings right from inside !BigBlueButton. You can now do that using the new optional Breakout Module. See this [http://bigbluebutton-blog.blogspot.com/2010/09/breakout-rooms-in-071.html blog post] for more info.

This feature will not be enabled by default in the final release.

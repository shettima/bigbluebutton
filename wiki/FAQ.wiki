== Installation ==
=== Can I install !BigBlueButton on CentOS? ===
Yes, you can! [InstallingBigBlueButtonCentOS CentOS instructions]
=== Can I install on Windows? ===
Short answer: no. While it may be possible to install most components needed to run BBB on Windows, we haven't tested this and it would be a pain. Consider downloading the Virtual Machine and running it from Windows instead.
=== Can I install on Debian? ===
Installing on Debian should be similar to the Ubuntu installation. Let us know if you run into problems and we'll help you set it up.
=== Can I install on !RedHat, Fedora? ===
This should be similar to CentOS, but we haven't tried it. Again, let us know if you run into problems.

== Administration of your BBB System ==
=== How do I update my VM to the newest version? ===
If you are running a !BigBlueButton VM or had installed !BigBlueButton using packages, you can upgrade to the newest stable release with the following two commands

{{{
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

If you would like to instead upgrade to the version currently under development, you can do that too. Note that the development version is often unstable, and nobody guarantees that it will work correctly. Here's how to do it:
Log into your VM, then edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list` and change

{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/ bigbluebutton main
}}}

to
{{{
#
# Repository for BigBlueButton
#
deb http://archive.bigbluebutton.org/dev bigbluebutton main
}}}

Do an `apt-get update/apt-get dist-upgrade` and you'll be running the latest builds, which are not guaranteed to be stable, but you can see what's happing in the current iteration.

=== VM won't resolve packages when updating, or is not connected to the internet ===
If you're using VM player, please go to VM>Settings>Network Adapter and make sure it is set to Bridged, with the box underneath left unchecked. 
Also restart the networking on the VM by running the following command:
{{{
  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}

=== My VM won't let me log in!%@^$! ===
When the VM first asks you to change the password, you will need to enter the password 'default' twice before it lets you change to a new password. Many people miss this. Try logging in with 'firstuser' - 'default' again.

=== BBB is running inside the VM, but I can't access it from a browser ===
Make sure your VMWave Player network settings are set to Bridged, not NAT. Go to Devices>Network Adapter, and select 'Bridged'

=== Something is not working in the VM ... where can I go for help. ===
The best source is to post to the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev bigbluebutton-dev] mailing list. We all hang out there and help each other.

=== Which log files should I check for errors?  ===
Check in the following files

   1. /var/lib/tomcat6/logs/localhost
   2. /usr/share/red5/logs 

If you would like to view the log dynamically, you can tail it in Linux by goind to the red5/log directory and executing the following command:

tail -f red.log

=== How to access the red5 directory on the VM ===
You might want access to the red5 directory on the Virtual Machine. The following commands will share a shortcut to the red5 folder into your dev directory.

In /usr/share/red5
  sudo chmod go+w log
  sudo chown -R firstuser *

In /home/firstuser/dev
  ln -s /usr/share/red5 red5

== Using BigBlueButton !BigBlueButton ==
=== How can I make desktop sharing faster? ===
BigBlueButton uses a lossless codec to capture the presenter's desktop.  If the presenter has a 32-bit background image, then the desktop sharing will send that image as well whenever it's visible.  This can slow down desktop sharing.

One easy way to speed up desktop sharing as a presenter is choose a solid color for your background image.  If you do, you'll notice that whenever the desktop is visible, the viewer's images will update relatively quickly as the algorithm is very efficient at sending solid colors.

== Developing for !BigBlueButton ==
=== Setting up the Dev environment ===
Refer to [Developing_BigBlueButton this].
=== I want to develop from Windows! ===
Even though the VM makes your life much easier, some people prefer to develop in their Windows environment instead. Once you have the development environment setup, you can mount the VM drive to Windows. When you launch Eclipse of Flex Builder simply create your workspace on the VM drive. This way you'll be developing in Windows with the source on the VM. Once you're ready to deploy, switch to the VM console and deploy using ant. We've found this is the easiest way to develop for !BigBlueButton.
=== How to compile and deploy the components of !BigBlueButton? ===
For most components of BBB, the source on the VM includes ant scripts which you can use to compile and deploy that particular component. If you have questions about compiling a specific component, write to the mailing list.
=== What if I want to develop for the Client only? ===
If you are just working on the client side, you need to edit the file config.xml (located in the src/conf folder) to point to a running instance of BigBlueButton. Change all the IP addresses in the file to the IP of your BBB server or BBB VM. In the entry for the Viewers Module, change the attribute host to host="conf/join-mock.xml". This will enable you to launch and test the client directly from the Flex environment, bypassing the Web component of BigBlueButton.
=== My client fails at startup with RSL error; Error 2035:URL Not Found ===
This is related to localization. Before you launch your client, you need to first separately run the ant localization task. This task is included in your client directory in the build.xml file. It needs to run separately because otherwise java will run out of memory if all tasks are ran together. You can run the localization task from the command line or from Flex if you've set up ant to work with Flex Builder. You can find instructions on how to get Ant working with Flex [http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=anttasks_1.html here]

== Virtual Machine ==

=== How do I update my VM to the newest version? ===
If you are running a !BigBlueButton VM or had installed !BigBlueButton using packages, you can upgrade to this release with the following two commands

{{{
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
}}}

=== Something is not working in the VM ... where can I go for help. ===
The best source is to post to the bigbluebutton-dev mailing list. We all hang out there and help each other.

=== Which log files should I check for errors?  ===
Check in the following files

   1. /var/lib/tomcat6/logs/localhost
   2. /usr/share/red5/logs 

If you would like to view the log dynamically, you can tail it in Linux by goind to the red5/log directory and executing the following command:

tail -f red.log

=== How to access the red5 directory on the VM ===
You might want access to the red5 directory on the Virtual Machine. The following commands will share a shortcut to the red5 folder into your dev directory.

In /usr/share/red5
  sudo chmod go+w log
  sudo chown -R firstuser *

In /home/firstuser/dev
  ln -s /usr/share/red5 red5

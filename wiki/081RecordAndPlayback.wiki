#summary Record and Playback in BigBlueButton 0.81.

<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />

This document assumes the reader understands the current [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ArchitectureOverview BigBlueButton architecture].


== Overview ===

!BigBlueButton records all the events and media data generated during a !BigBlueButton session for later playback. 

If you want to see the Record and Playback feature in action there is a [http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/demo/demo10.jsp demo], you can use it to record a !BigBlueButton session and play it after it is listed under "Recorded Sessions" on the same page, you should wait a few minutes after your session ends while the media is processed and published for playback. This demo is also available on your server if you have [https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/081InstallationUbuntu#6._Install_API_Demos installed it].


Like !BigBlueButton sessions, management of recordings should be handled by [http://www.bigbluebutton.org/open-source-integrations/ third party software].  Third party software consumes the [https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/API BigBlueButton API] to accomplish that. 


== Record and Playback Phases ==

!BigBlueButton processes the recordings in the following:

  # Capture
  # Archive
  # Sanity
  # Process
  # Publish
  # Playback



=== Capture ===
The Capture phase involves enabling the !BigBlueButton modules (chat, presentation, video, voice, etc.) to emit events over an event bus for capture on the !BigBlueButton server. Components that generate media (webcam, voice, desktop sharing) must also store their data streams on the server as well.

Whiteboard, cursor, chat and other events are stored on Redis. Webcam videos (.flv) and desktop sharing videos (.flv)  are recorded by Red5. The audio conference file (.wav) is recorded by Freeswitch.


=== Archive ===
The Archive phase involves taking the captured media and events into a *raw* directory. That directory contains ALL the necessary media and files to work with. 


=== Sanity === 
The Sanity phase involves checking that all the archived files are _valid_ for processing. For example
that media files have not zero length and events were archived.


=== Process ===
The Process phase involves processing the archived  valid files of the recording. Usually it
involves parsing the archived events, converting media files to other formats or concatenating them, etc.


=== Publish ===
The Publish phase involves generating metadata and taking many or all the processed recording files and placing them in a directory exposed publicly for later playback.



=== Playback ===
The Playback phase involves taking the published files (audio, webcam, deskshare, chat, events, metadata) and playing them
in the browser. 



== Media storage ==

Some Record and Playback phases store the media they handle in different directories

=== Captured files ===

_AUDIO_:   
/var/freeswitch/meetings

_WEBCAM_:   
/usr/share/red5/webapps/video/streams

_DESKTOP SHARING_:
/var/bigbluebutton/deskshare

_PRESENTATION_:
/var/bigbluebutton

_EVENTS_:
Redis

=== Archived files ===
/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/_*internal-meeting-id*_/

=== Sanity checked files ===
Same for archived files

=== Processed files ===
/var/bigbluebutton/recording/process/presentation/_*internal-meeting-id*_/

=== Published files ===
/var/bigbluebutton/recording/publish/presentation/_*internal-meeting-id*_/

=== Playback files ===
/var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/_*internal-meeting-id*_/


==  Manage recordings ==

BigBlueButton does not have an administrator web interface to control the sessions or recordings as in both cases they are handled by 3rd party software, but it has a useful tool to monitor the state and control your recordings through the phases described above.

In the terminal of your server you can execute "bbb-record", which will show you each option with its description

{{{

}}}

=== Useful terms === 
_*workflow*_ is the way a recording is processed, published and played . In !BigBlueButton 0.81 the unique workflow out of the box is the "presentation".

_*internal meetingId*_ is an alphanumeric string that internally identifies your recorded meeting. It is created internally by !BigBlueButton. For example "183f0bf3a0982a127bdb8161e0c44eb696b3e75c-1379693236230". 

_*external meetingID*_  is the id you set to the meeting, like "English 201" or "My Awesome class", "Chemistry 2". It is passed through the create API call.

_*recording*_ is recorded meeting in !BigBlueButton.

In !BigBlueButton you can use the same external meeting ID (for example "English 101") in many recordings but each recording will have a different internal meeting id. One external meeting id is associated with *one or many* internal meeting ids.



=== List recordings ===

{{{
bbb-record --list
}}} 

will list all your recordings.


=== Watch recordings ===
{{{
bbb-record --watch
}}} 

will list your latest 20 recordings, refreshing its output every 2 seconds. Its output is similar to this:

== For Developers ==

Here you will find more details about the Record and Playback feature. 


The unique way to start a recorded session in !BigBlueButton is setting the value "true" to the parameter "record" in the[https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/API#Create_Meeting create API call], which usually is handled by third party software.



*Capture phase*

The Capture phase is handled by many components, to understand how it works you should have basic, intermediate or advanced understanding about tools like Freeswitch, Flex, Red5 , Redis, dig into the [https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton  BigBlueButton source code], or search for information in the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev BigBlueButton mailing list for developers]




*Archive, Sanity, Process and Publish*

These phases are handled by Ruby scripts. The  directory for those files is /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/

The main file is rap-worker.rb, it executes all the Record and Playback phases

 # Detects when new captured media from a session is available.
 # Go through the Archive phase (/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/archive/archive.rb)
 # Go through the Sanity phase executing (/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/sanity/sanity.rb)  
 # Go through the Process phase executing all the scripts under /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/process/  
 # Go through the Publish phase executing all the scripts under /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/publish/

 * Files ending with "archiver.rb" contain scripts with logic to archive media.

 * Files under /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/lib/generators/ contains scripts with logic, classes and methods used by other scripts which archive or process  media.

 * Yml files contain information used by process and publish scripts.


*Playback phase*

It is handled by HTML, CSS and Javascript libraries. There is not any single video file for playback. Playback works with the javascript library Popcorn.js which shows the slides, chat and webcam according to the current time played in the audio file. Playback files are located in /var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/ and used to play any published recording.













== Troubleshooting ==

Apart from the command
{{{
sudo bbb-record --debug
}}}

You can use the output from 

{{{
sudo bbb-record --watch 
}}}

to detect problems with your recordings.

=== Understanding output from bbb-record-watch ===

[https://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/files/bbb-record-watch-explanation.PNG]




This section is intended to help you to find and in some cases to solve problems in the 
Record and Playback component of !BigBlueButton, watching the output of the command

{{{
bbb-record --watch
}}}

which output is explained [https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/RecordPlaybackSpecification#--watch here].   

Before trying anything, verify that the "rap worker", (file in charge of the record and playback phases),
is working. Execute this command to verify:

{{{
ps ax | grep god | grep -v grep
}}}

Output should be similar to: 

{{{
23317 pts/0    Sl     0:00 /usr/bin/ruby1.9.2 /usr/bin/god -c /etc/bigbluebutton/god/god.rb
}}}

If you don't get any output, start the rap worker manually

{{{
sudo god -c /etc/bigbluebutton/god/god.rb
}}}


===== RAS ( RECORDED - ARCHIVED - SANITY CHECK ) =====

Below *RAS* you won't see any *_X_* until the meeting has finished.

Once the meeting has finished, an *_X_* under *R* appears, if it does not appear:

 * Be sure all users left the meeting.

 * Check out that the parameter _defaultMeetingExpireDuration_ in _/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties_ does not have a big value (default to 1).

 * Be sure the parameter _record=true_ was passed in the _create_ api call. If not, you didn't record the meeting.

Once the recording is archived, an *_X_* under *A* appears, if it does not appear:

 * Verify this this file exists

_/var/bigbluebutton/recording/status/recorded/INTERNAL-MEETING-ID.done_

that means that the meeting was recorded.

Once the recording passed the sanity check , an *_X_* appears under *S*, if it does not appear:

 * A media file was not properly archived, find the cause of the problem in the sanity log 

{{{
grep INTERNAL-MEETING-ID /var/log/bigbluebutton/sanity.log
}}}


===== APVD =====

This section is related to recorded media. By default Audio and Presentation are recorded, if you don't see any *_X_* under *V* or *D*, then you haven't
shared your webcam or desktop, or you haven't enabled webcam or deskshare to be recorded, [MatterhornIntegration#Ensure_BigBlueButton_records_video_and_desktop_session ensure BigBlueButton is configured to record video and desktop session].

===== APVDE =====

This section is related to archived media. If you don't see an *_X_* under a media you are sure that was recorded, check out 
the sanity log. Execute this command to find the problem:

{{{
grep INTERNAL-MEETING-ID /var/log/bigbluebutton/sanity.log
}}}


===== Processed =====

If a script was applied to process your recording, its name should be listed under the column 'Processed', by default you should see "slides" and
"presentation", if you don't see one of them, find the problem in the log file of the processed recording:

{{{
grep -B 3 "status: 1" /var/log/bigbluebutton/presentation/process-INTERNAL-MEETING-ID.log | grep ERROR
}}}

{{{
grep -B 3 "status: 1" /var/log/bigbluebutton/slides/process-INTERNAL-MEETING-ID.log | grep ERROR
}}}

If there is some output it should show the problem. If there is not any output then tail the file to see which is the
latest executed task , sure that is the one that failed and an error message with the problem is described few lines after.

===== Published =====

If a script is applied to publish your recording, its name should be listed under the column 'Published', by default you should see "slides" and
"presentation", if you don't see one of them, find the problem in the log file of the published recording .

{{{
grep -B 3 "status: 1" /var/log/bigbluebutton/presentation/publish-INTERNAL-MEETING-ID.log | grep ERROR
}}}

{{{
grep -B 3 "status: 1" /var/log/bigbluebutton/slides/publish-INTERNAL-MEETING-ID.log | grep ERROR
}}}

If there is some output then you found the problem, if there is not any output then tail the file to see which is the
latest executed task , sure that is the one that failed and an error message with the problem is described few lines after.

## Checkout Source ##
As of BigBlueButton 0.70 the we host the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bigbluebutton).

## Download Source ##
If you don't want to checkout the source using git, you can download it from the [project webpage](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) on GitHub.

## What is Git? ##
If you're not familiar with Git, here's a really good [free book](http://progit.org/book/). The GitHub website has very detailed [help pages](http://help.github.com/) as well.

## Looking for the pre-0.70 source? ##
You can checkout the older source from here:

```
svn checkout http://bigbluebutton.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bigbluebutton-read-only
```

We have deleted the code in the repository to ensure there was no confusion between GitHub (where all latest development is occurring) and the out-of-date svn.  But you can easily revert to previous version of the repository to get access to all the pre-0.70 source.

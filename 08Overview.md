## Audio Settings Dialog ##

Clicking on the headset icon will now display an Audio Settings dialog to enable the user to

  1. adjust the sensitivity of their headset's microphone

The following image shows the sequence of steps from when the user clicks the headset icon.

## Video Dock ##

By default a webcam will now appear within the Video Dock module, a new window that let's users easily arrange a set of remote webcams on their desk.

For example, they can arrange them vertically

or horizontally.

## Push To Talk ##
As discussed in the [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/03965da6cbbc2f14), BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-3 adds a 'push to talk' button to enable students to un-mute themselves and ask questions during the session.

For control, moderators can click the 'lock' icon next to the student's name to both lock the student's audio as muted/unmuted and remove the student's 'push to talk' button.

## Fit-to-width ##
BigBlueButton 0.8-beta-4 can now properly display a portrait document using fit-to-width layout.

There are now two buttons on visible to the presenter for switching between fit-to-width and fit-to-page.

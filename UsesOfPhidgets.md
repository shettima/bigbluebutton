# Introduction #

Please contribute your ideas on using phidgets in BigBlueButton.


# Details #

The following user stories describe opportunities for using phidgets. They are the results of a number of brainstorming sessions as well as contributions from the community.

## Confusion Meter (was Red/Green/Yellow) ##

A feedback mechanism for remote users to indicate their level of confusion. Red - high level of confusion (something needs to be done). Green - low level of confusion. Yellow - changing from green to red. Colored LEDs can be used to indicate the confusion level. Uses: [interface kit](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1012).

## Participation Thermometer ##

Notify moderator or in-class users in a hybrid class room (with both local and remote students) as remote users join or drop. This would also provide visibility to in-class users of the remote users, and help integrate both groups. Could also use this to keep track of audio users. This could be implemented in different ways, eg using [LEDs](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1012) or a needle on a dial moved by a [servo motor](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=11&product_id=2000).

## Beeper (or We Can't Hear You Indicator) ##

Indicate that remote users cannot hear the audio. For instance, the moderator may have forgotten to unmute a participant. There is no way of user informing the moderator through the audio link. The chat window may also be covered. Could use a blinking [LED](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1012), or some play to play a sound (don't know which phidget to use).

## Clicker ##

Build a clicker from [touch sensors](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1110) or [force sensors](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=3&product_id=1106). Use [LEDs](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1012) to show the result, or show it on the screen.

## Not sure I understand button ##

Similar to the Hands Up feature, but using a Phidget sensor. This is an example of an opportunity to use Phidgets at the remote user's end.

## Visitor ##

Using a Participation Meter or in some other way (eg using a [relay](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=9&product_id=3052) to turn on a lamp) notify us that somebody is using the BigBlueButton demo server.

## Zooming ##

Use a touch sensor for zomming in and out of a presentation. Could use a [linear touch sensor](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=4&product_id=1015).

## Gesture Recognition ##

Use an [accelerometer](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=5&product_id=1059) as a gesture device.

## Shadow Detection ##

My notes say: using an infrared (sensor) vs shadow on a whiteboard (don't know what we meant by this).


## Server Status ##

Use an [LED](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1012) or a [servo motor](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=11&product_id=2000) to notify an administrator of the status of a BigBlueButton server.

## 2D/3D Space ##

Use [distance](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=2), [motion](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=5) and [light](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=6&product_id=1127) sensors to track movement of a presenter in a room, and use that information to do things such as switching to another camera (eg for a whiteboard or to show an experiment in a classroom).

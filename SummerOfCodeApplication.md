BigBlueButton's SoC profile can be found [here](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/bigbluebutton_soc).

Before you submit your application feel free to discuss your project proposal with the project by writing to our developer mailing list at [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2). This way we can give you feedback on your proposal, and it will give you a good idea of the overview of the project and introduce you to the BigBlueButton community. If you'd like to chat with a developer or other potential summer of code students, you can visit our IRC channel at #bigbluebutton on freenode.net.  You can experience BigBlueButton itself using our [demo server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/) (be sure to check out these short [videos](http://bigbluebutton.org/content/videos) on how BigBlueButton works first).

Here are some questions to get you started on your proposal. You don't have to follow it and you're application will still be considered, but it's a good place to start. Feel free to include anything else you feel is important.

  1. Email address we can reach you at.

## Project Questions ##

  1. What idea did you choose?
  1. Elaborate on the idea and describe what you would like to accomplish during the summer. This question is especially important if you have your own idea instead of picking one from our list, as we want to have a good understanding of what you're proposing so we can help you take the idea forward.
  1. If your project is very successful, do you wish to contributing to it further once Google Summer of Code is complete?
  1. Give us a brief timeline of the project for the things you'd like to accomplish.
  1. Have you discussed your project with the community? If yes, please include a link to the discussion in your application. You can get a link by browsing the list archive online.
  1. Feeling ambitious? Try to build BigBlueButton from source. It's by no means an easy task! And we don't mean use the provided scripts/packages. We mean [source](http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallingBigBlueButton). It's like a rite of passage around here. Let us know how your journey went.
  1. Feeling really ambitious? Go through our [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/issues/list) and fix a bug. Try submitting a patch.
